# BlueROV2 MPC
This work implements a NMPC controller for BlueROV2 with ROS.

## Prerequisites
* Python 3.7
* ROS ([ROS noetic](http://wiki.ros.org/noetic/Installation/Ubuntu) recommended)
* [uuv simulator](https://uuvsimulator.github.io/)
* [MAVROS](http://wiki.ros.org/mavros)
* [Acados](https://docs.acados.org/installation/index.html)

We also provide its [docker image](https://github.com/HKPolyU-UAV/airo_docker_lib) to save you some time.

## Getting started
1. Install python 3.7 and its dependencies
    ```
    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install -y python3.7

    apt-get install -y python3-pip

    pip3 install numpy matplotlib scipy future-fstrings casadi>=3.5.1 setuptools
    sudo apt-get install -y python3.7-tk
    ```
2. Install Acados
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/acados/acados.git
    cd acados
    git submodule update --recursive --init
    mkdir -p build
    cd build
    cmake -DACADOS_WITH_QPOASES=ON -DACADOS_WITH_OSQP=OFF/ON -DACADOS_INSTALL_DIR=<path_to_acados_installation_folder> ..
    make install -j4

    pip install -e ~/acados/interfaces/acados_template

    echo 'export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:"/root/acados/lib"' >> ~/.bashrc 
    echo 'export ACADOS_SOURCE_DIR="/root/acados"' >> ~/.bashrc
    source ~/.bashrc
    ```

3. Install ros uuv-simulator packages
    ```
    sudo apt-get install -y ros-noetic-geodesy
    mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws/src && \
    cd ~/catkin_ws/src && \
    git clone --branch noetic https://github.com/arturmiller/uuv_simulator.git
    ```

4. Install then compile this package
    ```
    cd ~/catkin_ws/src && \
    git clone --branch noetic https://github.com/arturmiller/uuv_simulator.git
    ```
    Please edit CMakelists.txt [here](/bluerov2_dobmpc/CMakeLists.txt) and [here](/bluerov2_mpc/CMakeLists.txt) if you put your acados in otherwise directory. Modify the line ```set(acados_include "~/acados/include")``` and ```set(acados_lib "~/acados/lib")```
    
    Then do
    ```
    cd ~/catkin_ws/src/bluerov2/bluerov2_dobmpc/scripts && \
    yes | python3 generate_c_code.py
    ```
    and
    ```
    cd ~/catkin_ws/src/bluerov2/bluerov2_mpc/scripts && \
    yes | python3 generate_c_code.py
    ```
    The last commands basically run generate_c_code.py at [here](/bluerov2_dobmpc/scripts/) and [here](/bluerov2_mpc/scripts/).

    Finally, do
    ```
    cd ~/catkin_ws && catkin_make
    ```

## Start simulation without controller
Ocean_waves in uuv simulator is set as default world.

Quick start to initialize the Gazebo world and add blueROV2 vehicle
```
roslaunch bluerov2_gazebo quick_start.launch
```
Or start with thruster manager
```
roslaunch bluerov2_gazebo start_with_thruster_manager.launch
```
With thruster manager, forces and moments can be published to topic /bluerov2/thruster_manager/input.

## Start simulation with PID controller
Start PID controller with teleop (using joystick)
```
roslaunch bluerov2_gazebo start_pid_demo_with_teleop.launch
```
Or start PID Controller without teleop
```
roslaunch bluerov2_gazebo start_pid_demo.launch
```

Further trajectory tracking tasks can be done with uuv_control_utils package, such as following linear trajectory
```
roslaunch uuv_control_utils send_waypoints_file.launch uuv_name:=bluerov2 interpolator:=linear
```
Or following helical trajectory
```
roslaunch uuv_control_utils start_helical_trajectory.launch uuv_name:=bluerov2 n_turns:=2
```

## Start simulation with MPC controller
A demonstration of starting MPC controler to follow circular trajectory can be launched by
```
roslaunch bluerov2_gazebo start_mpc_demo.launch
```
The bluerov2_mpc package also includes more trajectory following tasks such as following leminscate path and self defined waypoints.

## Disturbance generator
The uuv simulator provides [disturbance generation functions](https://uuvsimulator.github.io/packages/uuv_simulator/docs/tutorials/disturbances/) for testing the vehicle.

A demonstration of starting simulation with random current disturbances can be launched by
```
roslaunch bluerov2_gazebo start_pid_with_current.launch    (with PID controller)
roslaunch bluerov2_gazebo start_mpc_with_current.launch    (with MPC controller)
```
Disturbances can also be generated by using ROS service call
```
rosservice call /hydrodynamics/set_current_velocity_model "{mean: 0.0, min: 0.0, max: 0.0, noise: 0.0, mu: 0.0}"
rosservice call /hydrodynamics/set_current_horz_angle_model "{mean: 0.0, min: 0.0, max: 0.0, noise: 0.0, mu: 0.0}"
rosservice call /hydrodynamics/set_current_vert_angle_model "{mean: 0.0, min: 0.0, max: 0.0, noise: 0.0, mu: 0.0}"
```
